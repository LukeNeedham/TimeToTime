# TimeToTime

![Workflow result](https://github.com/LukeNeedham/TimeToTime/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
A simple countdown timer in a picturesque environment.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This project was my very first experience with Compose!
I wanted to build something that would allow me to experiment with lots of
different features of Compose - and I certainly know a lot more about it now!

I've used a mixture of Compose animation APIs,
investigated percentage-based sizing,
injected a ViewModel into a Composable,
and even added gesture support for pinch-to=zoom.

Try pinching the clock to see what happens...
